###Thanks for checking out my portfolio!###

It doesnt look like much, but it wont stay that way forever. Most of my work that is portfolio worthy is stashed away in companies repositories. I have worked with multiple teams through many iterations of both client facing projects and internal software tools.

Feel free to reach out @ peterson.justin11@gmail.com if you have questions or want to see more!

Check out these vimeo links for a some other examples of projects I've worked on.
