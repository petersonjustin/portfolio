Thanks for checking out my portfolio!
========================================
It doesnt look like much, but it wont stay that way forever. Most of my work that is portfolio worthy is stashed away in companies repositories. I have worked with multiple teams through many iterations of both client facing projects and internal software tools.

Feel free to reach out @ peterson.justin11@gmail.com if you have questions or want to see more!

Check out these vimeo links for a some other examples of projects I've worked on.

## Check out other repo's I've contributed to! 
https://github.com/SunKD/disappointed_fan - A group project built in less than a week. We queried Twitter's API for tweets that were written by salty fans in the hope of finding a twitter version of "Fan bloopers". Turns out, unless you want to pay Twitter, getting data from them is really difficult and gated. I worked on the responsive design and prototyped the first twitter curl approach which we later cut for an already established 3rd party library. 
https://github.com/prescottbreeden/_31_by_3 - A C# project where our team built the traditional Casion game "31". Hoping to have a live version of this available soon.
