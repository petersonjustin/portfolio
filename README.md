Thanks for checking out my portfolio!
========================================
It doesnt look like much, but it wont stay that way forever. Most of my work that is portfolio worthy is stashed away in companies repositories. I have worked with multiple teams through many iterations of both client facing projects and internal software tools. Two key things to keep in mind, none of the current projects on my portfolio or on this repo are responsive or have Accessibility integrated as most of them are prototypes, but I am very aware of and comfortable developing responsively accessible sites. See the Stormwater link below for an example of a WP site I built years ago!

Feel free to reach out @ peterson.justin11@gmail.com if you have questions or want to see more!

##Stormwater Risk Management
One of the first sites that I built solo for a marketing firm in Colorado Springs - Built off of Wordpress, I used a customized base theme that was created by myself and a friend to develop these small business sites more efficiently. This project used Sass, shortcodes and a custom plugin for the client to add new customers to their site.

## Check out other repo's I've contributed to! 
https://github.com/SunKD/disappointed_fan - A group project built in less than a week. We queried Twitter's API for tweets that were written by salty fans in the hope of finding a twitter version of "Fan bloopers". Turns out, unless you want to pay Twitter, getting data from them is really difficult and gated. I worked on the responsive design and prototyped the first twitter curl approach which we later cut for an already established 3rd party library. 
https://github.com/prescottbreeden/_31_by_3 - A C# project where our team built the traditional Casino game "31". Hoping to have a live version of this available soon.
