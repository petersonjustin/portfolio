## Sass Samples:
These folders contain samples of files produced on custom websites that I constructed. While early in my journey of becoming a developer, they are some of the few examples I'm allowed to share publicly.
Some were constructed based off of the "Bones" WP theme and others were built within a customized theme that I and a partner constructed from the ground up.

- Site #1 was for a non-profit site which was one of the first sites that I built.
